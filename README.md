# Job Scheduler

## Overview

The Job Scheduler is a Java application designed to simulate various CPU scheduling algorithms. Users can select from different scheduling strategies to see how they impact process execution. The main algorithms implemented are:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**

This project aims to provide an interactive platform for users to understand and visualize the effects of different scheduling methods.
